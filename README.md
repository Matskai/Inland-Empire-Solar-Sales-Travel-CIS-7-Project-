In this project, we are determining the variations of the trip to the noted cities that a solar marketing specialist must take to market solar packages to homeowners. He starts from home in Riverside and needs to travel to Moreno Valley, Perris and Hemet. After calculating and determining the varying routes, we are then also determining the shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist. 


The interface implemented for the user is a printed list of options for the user to choose from, including: 
1.) Trip Planner (Trip Routing)
2.) Cost Effective (Quickest Path)
3.) Roads (Adjacencies)
4.) Map (Matrix)
After deciding, they will be prompted to enter the number of the choice they’ve made and the according data will be printed. If they wish to access other data, simply, they will still be able to do so by just entering the corresponding number like before, without having to rerun the program. The objective’s this program is to give the user their desired information with additional information comparing them to what the other routes look like. (Info will only regard the solar marketing specialist’s desired cities and no others) 

The limitations observed running our program were:
- That it can only display data to the cities and what the solar marketing specialist originally needed 
- It displays the cities assigned numbers instead of just the names, so it may be confusing and the user will have to look back and forth 

The limitation is that the coding ends at certain points where it won’t continue. I think we should make a code inside of it where the user can restart the program in the code to redo their choices or make a back option que. Choice 2 is not working that much but the other 3 work but just have to figure out choice 2
